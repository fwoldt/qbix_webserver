## 📋 Requirements: the PHP Extensions This Server Provides

This page is the standard: which PHP versions the server is built for, which
extensions every build carries, which ones a form of distribution cannot carry and
why, and what the server does when the PHP it runs on lacks something. The list
itself lives in one file, `build/extensions.json`; builds, the start-up check, the
dashboard and this page all read it. [extensions.md](extensions.md) shows how to
check a machine, plan a build and install what is missing.

### PHP versions

The static binaries are built for **PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5**. 8.3 is the default.
The phar, Composer package, Docker image and OS packages run on any PHP from **8.1**.

| Version | Note |
|---|---|
| 8.4 | `imap`, `oci8` and `pdo_oci` are no longer bundled with PHP; they build from PECL. |
| 8.5 | `opcache` is always compiled in and cannot be left out. |

Always-present parts of PHP are not listed below, since no build can lack them:
Core, `date`, `hash`, `json`, `pcre`, `random`, `Reflection`, `SPL` and `standard`.

### Tiers

Every extension belongs to one tier.

| Tier | What it means |
|---|---|
| **server** | What the server itself needs to run and to isolate requests. |
| **required** | What the standard application platform needs to run. A PHP without one of these is not a supported platform. |
| **recommended** | The default extensions of the platform, every database driver that can be linked statically, and caching. |
| **extra** | Everything else static-php-cli can build on that platform. |
| **other** | Known, but in no variant: development tools (xdebug, pcov, profilers), runtimes that conflict with the server's own workers (swoole, swow), and drivers that need a proprietary library at run time. Add one to a build with `ext:build --with=`. |

### Variants

Variants stack tiers, so each one carries everything the smaller ones do.

| Variant | Tiers | For |
|---|---|---|
| **mini** | server | The smallest binary: the server and plain PHP applications. |
| **lite** | server, required | The standard application platform, with nothing extra. |
| **standard** | server, required, recommended | The default: lite plus every static database driver, caching and full image support. |
| **full** | server, required, recommended, extra | Everything static-php-cli can build on the platform. |
| **source** | as full | Not a binary: a kit (the phar, the manifest, the console and the static-php-cli recipe, with `BUILD.md`) that builds any variant on the machine it is for. |

How many extensions a variant has on each static platform (PHP 8.3):

| Variant | Linux x86-64 | Linux ARM64 | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mini | 11 | 11 | 11 | 9 |
| lite | 30 | 30 | 30 | 26 |
| standard | 49 | 49 | 51 | 40 |
| full | 93 | 93 | 95 | 66 |

### Databases

| Database | Extensions | How it is provided |
|---|---|---|
| MySQL / MariaDB | `mysqli`, `mysqlnd`, `pdo_mysql` | Built in (required tier) |
| PostgreSQL | `pgsql`, `pdo_pgsql` | Built in (recommended) |
| SQLite | `sqlite3`, `pdo_sqlite` | Built in (`sqlite3` is in the server tier) |
| MongoDB | `mongodb` | Built in (recommended); not in the Windows binary |
| ODBC | `odbc`, `pdo_odbc` | Built in (recommended); see the static Linux exception below |
| Oracle | `oci8`, `pdo_oci` | **Loadable add-on**: needs Oracle Instant Client, a proprietary shared library that cannot be linked into a static binary. Included in the Docker image; `ext:install-hint oci8` prints the steps elsewhere. |
| Firebird | `pdo_firebird` | **Loadable add-on**: needs the Firebird client library. Included in the Docker image. (The old `interbase` extension was removed from PHP in 7.4.) |
| SQL Server | `sqlsrv`, `pdo_sqlsrv` | **Documented install**: needs Microsoft's ODBC Driver for SQL Server at run time. `ext:install-hint sqlsrv` prints the steps. |
| Microsoft Access | through `odbc` / `pdo_odbc` | **Documented install**: an Access ODBC driver (mdbtools on Linux, the Access Database Engine on Windows). `ext:install-hint msaccess` prints the steps. |

`qbixctl ext:check` reports an add-on as present when it is loaded; it never counts
a missing add-on or documented driver against the standard set.

### Caching and images

Caching in the standard set: **opcache** (with JIT), **apcu**, **redis** (Redis and
Valkey), **memcached** and **igbinary**. The older `memcache` client is in the extra
tier for libraries that still use it.

Images: **gd**, built with JPEG, PNG, WebP and FreeType, and **exif** for photo
metadata. The check looks inside gd: a gd without WebP or FreeType is reported as
incomplete, not as present. `imagick` is in the extra tier.

### Forms of distribution and their exceptions

Every form meets this standard except where a line below says otherwise.

| Form | What it carries | Exceptions |
|---|---|---|
| **Static binaries** ([binaries.md](binaries.md)) | The variant named in the file, compiled in | Per platform, below. A static binary cannot load extensions or C libraries at run time, so the loadable add-ons and documented drivers are not available in it. |
| **phar / Composer** | Whatever the host PHP has | Nothing can be added by the server; at start and on the dashboard it reports what the host PHP lacks, with the install command for that system. |
| **Docker image** ([docker.md](docker.md)) | The standard set, plus the Oracle and Firebird add-ons and ODBC drivers | On Debian (glibc), so Oracle Instant Client works. |
| **OS packages** ([packages.md](packages.md)) | Depend on the distribution's own PHP extension packages | Whatever that distribution does not package for its PHP version is reported by `ext:check` after install. |

Static-binary exceptions, by platform:

- **Windows**: no `pcntl` or `posix` (there is no `fork()`; isolation comes from
  `qbix_fork.dll`, or php-cgi), no `intl` (the ICU bundle needs C++17, which PHP's
  Windows build does not use for intl) and no `xsl` (static-php-cli cannot build
  libxslt there), plus the extensions static-php-cli does not build for Windows yet
  (`gmp`, `ldap`, `memcached`, `mongodb`, `odbc`, `readline`, `gettext` and others;
  `ext:plan --platform=windows-x64` lists them all). [binaries.md](binaries.md) has
  the detail and what would bring each back.
- **Linux (x86-64 and ARM64)**: the binaries are fully static (musl), which cannot
  load ODBC driver libraries at run time, so `odbc` and `pdo_odbc` are left out. Use
  the Docker image or OS packages for ODBC. `ffi` is left out for the same reason.
- **macOS**: carries the whole standard set, ODBC included.

A distribution PHP is judged by its own rules: the check applies a static build's
exceptions only when it runs inside one, and otherwise only what cannot exist on
the OS at all (such as `pcntl` on Windows).

### At start-up

- **Refuses to start** only without what this configuration cannot run without:
  process isolation (`pcntl`, or a php-cgi binary), `tokenizer` while the source
  transform is on, and `openssl` when HTTPS is configured. It prints the install
  command and exits.
- **Warns once** when extensions from the standard set are missing, listing them by
  tier with the install command for this system. `Q.webserver.extensionsCheck =
  false` silences the warning; it never skips the refusal.
- **Reports** the same on the dashboard's Extensions card and in `/Q/health` under
  `extensions`: the largest variant this PHP provides (`variant_detected`), what is
  missing per tier, incomplete extensions, and the install commands.

### Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `qbixctl ext:check` | This PHP against the standard set. Exit 0: nothing missing; 1: a required extension is missing; 2: only recommended ones are. `--format=json` for scripts. |
| `qbixctl ext:list --variant=standard --platform=linux-x86_64 --php=8.3` | What a variant carries. `--format=spc` and `--format=libs` print what a build passes to static-php-cli. |
| `qbixctl ext:plan --variant=full --platform=windows-x64` | What a build includes, what it leaves out and why, and the commands. |
| `qbixctl ext:install-hint intl redis` | The install commands for this system (apt, dnf, Remi collections, Plesk, apk, pkg, Homebrew or Windows). With no names: everything `ext:check` finds missing. Also takes `oci8`, `pdo_oci`, `pdo_firebird`, `sqlsrv`, `pdo_sqlsrv` and `msaccess`. |
| `qbixctl ext:build --variant=standard --php=8.4` | Builds a static PHP and server binary for this machine with static-php-cli; `--variant=source` writes the kit. `--dry-run` prints the commands. |

[extensions.md](extensions.md) walks through each.
