/**
 * The output buffer a persistent process captures a script's response in.
 *
 * A script's output has to be collected rather than written to stdout, and the
 * buffer that collects it has to survive the script: applications end their own
 * buffers with loops such as `while (@ob_end_clean());`, which would take a
 * normal buffer -- and the response in it -- along with them.
 *
 * That used to be done with ob_start(null, 0, 0) on every request. Flags 0 make
 * a buffer impossible to remove, which protects it, but also impossible to
 * clean or remove *afterwards*: the @ob_clean() meant to empty it failed
 * silently, and the next request stacked another one on top. One buffer, with
 * that request's whole page in it, was left behind per request for the life of
 * the process -- measured at ~2 MB a request on an Exponential install, a
 * worker at 1.1 GB after 600 requests. The response still came out right,
 * because ob_get_contents() read whichever buffer was on top, which is why
 * nothing looked wrong.
 *
 * Here there is one buffer per process, opened on first use and kept for the
 * process's life:
 *
 *   - It is cleanable and flushable but not removable, so an application's
 *     end-of-buffer loop stops at it, and ob_clean() still discards what the
 *     script printed, as it would anywhere. (PHP declines to end it without
 *     cleaning it, so output printed before such a loop is kept -- as it was
 *     with the buffer this replaced. Making it removable would instead send
 *     everything after the loop to the process's real stdout.)
 *   - Its handler moves flushed output out of the buffer into a string, so the
 *     buffer itself is empty between requests and nothing accumulates in it.
 *   - Buffers the script leaves open are flushed down into it at the end, as
 *     PHP does at the end of a request; the response is everything the script
 *     printed, not whichever buffer happened to be on top.
 *
 * balanced() is the invariant a caller can check after every request: exactly
 * one buffer, ours, and empty. A process that fails it has lost track of its
 * output and should be replaced rather than trusted with the next request.
