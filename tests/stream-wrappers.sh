# Regression test: a script cannot unregister the wrappers the server
# reads itself through.
#
# Hardened applications drop the phar wrapper — eZ Publish, Drupal and
# others have done it since the 2018 phar deserialisation work:
#
#     if (PHP_SAPI !== 'cli' && in_array('phar', stream_get_wrappers())) {
#         stream_wrapper_unregister('phar');
#     }
#
# The guard spares CLI. This SAPI is called micro, so it does not apply,
# and in a single-file build the server lives in that phar and autoloads
# its own classes from phar:// paths. One page view took the runtime out
# from under itself — invisibly, since preloaded classes kept working and
# only a request needing a new one failed, reporting whatever class that
# request wanted. A worker outlives the request, so the damage stayed for
# every later request it handled.
#
# Needs the binary: from a source checkout there is no phar to lose, and
# every assertion here passes without meaning anything.
#
