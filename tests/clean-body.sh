# Regression test: a response body carries what the script wrote, and
# nothing the engine had to say about it.
#
# PHP assigns $context to every stream wrapper instance opened with a
# context. Q_WebServer_CompatFileWrapper never declared the property, so
# PHP 8.2+ reported a dynamic property on each include, and with the
# default display_errors those notices went into the response body ahead
# of the script's own output.
#
# On a text page that was a stray paragraph. On a generated image it was
# fatal: a captcha came back with 1.5KB of notices in front of the PNG
# signature, so the file would not open — served as image/png, with a 200,
# and nothing in the error log.
#
# It only reproduces when the server runs from the phar: including a file
# from inside it passes the wrapper a context, and running from source
# does not. So this test drives ./bin/qbixserver when one is built and
# says so when it has to fall back to the sources, where it proves
# nothing. That is the same gap that let the UPX-corrupted binaries and a
# gd-less build ship: the suite tests a configuration nobody receives.
#
#   ./tests/clean-body.sh          uses bin/qbixserver if present
#   QB=/path/to/binary ./tests/clean-body.sh
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure.
