/**
 * An include never reads the head of one version of a file and the tail of
 * the next.
 *
 * file_get_contents() reads in 8 KB chunks. A file rewritten in place --
 * opened "w", truncated, written again -- between two of those chunks came
 * back as a mixture of two versions: valid PHP, so it ran, and it was answered
 * as a 200. Seen once in tens of thousands of requests in the include race
 * test, as 'V000096:...00009' . '97,...:V000097'. The compat wrapper now reads
 * a file in one read of its whole size and keeps the bytes only if the file
 * did not change while it read (CompatFileWrapper::readWhole()).
 *
 * A forked writer rewrites a 2 MB file in place, as fast as it can, with
 * versions of different lengths, while this process reads it repeatedly both
 * ways. The plain chunked read is counted tearing, to show the race was real
 * (the old read failed this test in most runs), and readWhole() must never.
